- 🎓 I'm currently studying in [Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26)
- 🌍 I’m from Portugal so feel free to talk with me in Portuguese. Otherwise English is more than fine too 😄
- ⚡ I've worked with: Javascript, React, Java, Golang, Python, etc..
